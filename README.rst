Massive Logs
========================

### Brief description

This project was for getting to know with Map-Reduce paradigm, with [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/). 
It has a trivial use case of counting and grouping requested urls in Apache server logs.
We also provide set of bash scripts to make it easier to run hadoop jobs.
